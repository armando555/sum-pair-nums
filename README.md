This is the code interview for mach eight

This repository has 3 different solution the first one [here](n2solution_two_loops.py) is using two loops that generate a Big O (n²). This solution was for understading the problem and how to improve it

The second one solution [here](n2solution_divide_conquer.py) was using divide and conquer gaining a big O(n*logn) to try to reduce the length of the array and make the algorithm a little faster than O(n²). In worst case this algorithm is going to be O(n²)
